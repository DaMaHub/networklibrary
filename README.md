Building a network library from first principals


Network Library Toolkit
=========================

The xlibrary folder contains the install instructions for the toolkit.

The toolkit is a graphic interface for interacting with a network library, allowing the creation of 'smart' reference contracts for datatypes, data packaging, computation and visualisations.  Form inputs are validated by library composers.  Saved reference contract can be view back by type and reference identifiers can be used other applications.

Demonstration:

Inputs into a <a href="https://youtu.be/OuJEGhPP4B4">data science toolkit</>


Implementation status
=====================

This is the concept implementation of the founding idea of the DaMaHub Project.  The reference contracts are stored using the hypercore protocol but the goal is to give each peer the freedom to select a store protocol of their choosing.

Peer to Peer Replication:  The next stage is to experiment with way to share governance over the reference contracts.
